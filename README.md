# Refresh-Roulette
Welcome to our web application, Refresh and Roulette!

To get started, run the local JSON server. If you're not familiar with how to perform this task,
do not worry, we have you covered! We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this project.
We wanted to make a fun game so users can enjoy themselves.
There are five randomized questions. If no answer is chosen, you will not be able to proceed,

so make sure you select an answer. After the last question, your results will be posted, and if you have an

extra minute, please fill out our feedback form. Let us know how we did!

Enjoy your stay, and share this with your friends!

Best, Refresh & Roulette Team
